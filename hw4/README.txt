Steps to run PL/0 Compiler from command line:

1. Add all files (input files and hw4compiler.c) to working directory
2. Type "gcc hw4compiler.c -o cmp" into the command line
3. Type "./cmp [input_file_name].txt" into the command line to print to console or "./cmp [input_file_name].txt>[output_file_name]" to redirect the output to a file

Results from the PL/0 Compiler will be printed into console. Check directory to find "elf.txt", which will store VM instructions of the given input.

Thank you.
