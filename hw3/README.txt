Steps to run Recursive Descent Parser and Intermediate Code Generator for tiny PL/0 from command line:

1. Add all files (input files and parsercodegen.c) to working directory
2. Type "gcc parsercodegen.c -o pcg" into the command line
3. Type "./pcg [input_file_name].txt" into the command line to print to console
    or "./pcg [input_file_name].txt>[output_file_name]" to redirect the utput to a file

Assembly code and the corresponding symbol table for the PL/0 program will be printed as output.

Thank you.
